# Toilet Paper Holder
#### November 12, 2015


Matt, Ryan, and I have pretty much fully moved in to our new house in San Francisco.  It's great, except for one glaring issue:

**The toilet paper holder is too small for our toilet paper.**


## Problem

As you can see, the alcove is not large enough to accommodate a Costco-sized fresh roll and allow it to rotate.

## Solution

Design and 3d print a custom holder for the roll!  I spent a week or so iterating on a design, and eventually got a great solution!

The final design has these features:

* Cantilever to shift the TP axis of rotation out from the wall 6cm, and upwards 1cm
* Protrusions to brace the assembly so that it does not rotate downwards
* A friction-fit mate between the left and right sides of the assembly
