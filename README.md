This is my personal website.  Here's how it works:

1. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) is used to compile:
  * An [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) app
  * [Less](http://lesscss.org) styling into CSS
  * JavaScript libraries installed with [Bower](http://bower.io)
1. [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) serves the static assets, with [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) sitting in front and providing free fake-ish SSL
