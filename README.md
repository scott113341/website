This is my personal website.  Here's how it works:

1. [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is used to compile:
  * An [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) app
  * [Less](http://lesscss.org/) styling into CSS
  * JavaScript libraries installed with [Bower](http://bower.io/)

2. [Express](http://expressjs.com/) is used to serve up these static assets

3. [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) hosts the website on a free instance because they're awesome
