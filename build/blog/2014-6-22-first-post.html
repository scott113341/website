<p>This is my first blog post, mostly for testing purposes to make sure my code works, but I might as well ramble about the ill-defined nature of this blog.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not really sure how often I&#39;ll be posting on here or what I&#39;ll be posting about, but I&#39;ve long wanted a blog where I can at least jot down my thoughts.  Since I was already coding my personal website, I figured I&#39;d add in some blogging functionality!  Hopefully I can interest people from time to time with whatever I decide to write about.  </p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
