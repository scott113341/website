<h1 id="living-in-my-car">Living in my Car</h1>
<h4 id="august-30-2015">August 30, 2015</h4>
<p>Starting on Tuesday, September 1st, I will be living out of my car.</p>
<p>I&#39;m excited and nervous.  Excited because I&#39;ve always wanted to try this, just to see what it&#39;s like.  Nervous because I&#39;m rushing headlong and unprepared into a cloud of unknowns.  Fortunately, I don&#39;t have to continue living in my car if I hate it.  But this is the perfect opportunity to try.</p>
<h2 id="planned-daily-schedule">Planned Daily Schedule</h2>
<ol>
<li>Wake up around 6am<ul>
<li>Sleep in my car in the eBay parking lot</li>
<li>Wake up when the sun rises, which should be easy because it&#39;ll get really bright</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to Planet Granite every morning<ul>
<li>Exercise (indoor bouldering, gym, or run)</li>
<li>Shower, shave (towels provided)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to work<ul>
<li>eBay has free breakfast every morning, which is great</li>
<li>Also, free fruit</li>
<li>Lunch will be cereal, leftovers, or eating out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to a library<ul>
<li>Northside Branch Library or Santa Clara University Library seem solid</li>
<li>Read and/or work on side projects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hang out with friends<ul>
<li>This will be a big one, and an area where I&#39;m anticipating my life to improve.  Since I don&#39;t want to go home (aka sit in my car), it will propel me to spend more time with friends</li>
<li>No more video games (no more desktop PC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eat dinner<ul>
<li>Cooking out of my car might be difficult</li>
<li>Eating out isn&#39;t very healthy; Whole Foods buffet is a notable exception</li>
<li>I&#39;ll likely cook at least a meal or two each week at Vanessa&#39;s and eat with her</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to sleep around 11pm</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="anticipated-difficulties">Anticipated Difficulties</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cooking for myself and doing dishes</li>
<li>Keeping my car (and its contents/inhabitant) from smelling bad</li>
<li>Doing laundry</li>
<li>Regulating temperature while sleeping</li>
</ul>
<p>But my biggest fear going into this endeavour is that I&#39;ll be too dependent on Vanessa&#39;s house as a &quot;home base&quot;.  Being cognizant of this will surely help, but it will definitely be a fuzzy line since I want to spend a lot of time with her.  I don&#39;t want to mooch, but I want to be with her a lot.  We&#39;ve agreed to be very open in our communication about this.</p>
<h2 id="things-to-have-in-my-car">Things to Have in my Car</h2>
<p>I have to immensely strip down the amount of stuff I bring with me, since my car is pretty small.  Vanessa has graciously allowed me to keep most of my stuff in her basement storage room, so I won&#39;t have to rent a storage unit.  The few things I plan on always having with me are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Laptops and chargers</li>
<li>Mouse and mousepad</li>
<li>Power inverter</li>
<li>Clothes (maybe 10 days&#39; worth)</li>
<li>Workout clothes</li>
<li>Duffel bag</li>
<li>Laundry bag</li>
<li>Ziploc bags</li>
<li>Trash bags</li>
<li>Toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, floss picks, retainer</li>
<li>Shampoo, body wash, washcloth, towel</li>
<li>Electric razor, comb, nail clippers</li>
<li>Hand sanitizer</li>
<li>Paper towels</li>
<li>Spork</li>
<li>Knife</li>
<li>24oz, 40oz, 64oz Hydroflask water bottles</li>
<li>Headlamp</li>
<li>Futon (this is my current bed)</li>
<li>Blanket</li>
<li>Pillow</li>
</ul>
