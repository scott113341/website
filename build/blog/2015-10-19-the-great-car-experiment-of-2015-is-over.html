<h4 id="october-19-2015">October 19, 2015</h4>
<p>After living in my car for the past month and a half, the experiment has ended.</p>
<p><strong>It was great.</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning, people thought I was crazy to do something like this.  My parents understandably never got used to it.  Overall, I immensely enjoyed the experience, and I would definitely do it again in the future without any qualms.</p>
<p>However, as the experiment progressed, I realized I wasn&#39;t truly <em>living out</em> of my car; I was really just <em>sleeping in</em> my car.  You could say I &quot;cheated&quot; by taking advantage of eBay perks like free breakfast and 24/7 bathroom access.  I&#39;m inclined to agree, but I wasn&#39;t trying to prove a point with this experiment.  I simply wanted to try something new.  Mission accomplished!</p>

<h2 id="things-that-should-have-been-hard-but-weren-t-">Things that Should Have Been Hard (but weren&#39;t)</h2>
<p><strong>Sleeping</strong>: My futon (which I&#39;ve been sleeping on for years and is the most comfortable bed I&#39;ve ever slept on) fit almost perfectly in the back of the Subaru.  Lying down flat, my entire body fit on the mattress easily.  It was pretty dark at night; I parked under a parking lot lamp post that had burnt out.  When they fixed the light a few weeks in, I parked under trees that provided shade from the lights.  Waking up early was pretty easy too, since I went to bed earlier and I was getting up at sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>Laundry</strong>: Found a great laundromat right next to Planet Granite: wash, dry, and fold for about two weeks of clothing was $15.</p>
<p><strong>Showering</strong>: Planet Granite gave me free showers with my expensive membership.  They provided towels, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.  This was really nice because I didn&#39;t have to try drying a towel and soap bottles inside my car.</p>
<p><strong>Bathroom</strong>: I had 24/7 access to the eBay building, so restrooms were always a minute walk away.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Never interacted the people who patrol the parking lot.  I registered my car with them as &quot;long-term parking&quot;.  Not sure if they knew someone was sleeping in it.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-learned">Things I Learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>Getting up early and exercising every morning is really good for me</li>
<li>I don&#39;t need as many things as I own</li>
<li>Being able to cook in your own kitchen is nice</li>
</ul>

<p>I wrote in an email to some family: &quot;Car living is officially... on hiatus.&quot;  I&#39;m maybe kidding.</p>
